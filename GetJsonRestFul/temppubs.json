            "abstract": "In this paper I analyze a standard argument for the conclusion that intentional properties are irrelevant to causal explanations of behavior. I then analyze an analogous argument for the conclusion that the property of genuineness is irrelevant to causal explanations of the effects that twenty-dollar bills have on human agents, and I indicate a way in which this argument fails. I then apply the lessons learned from the example of genuineness to articulate a defense for the causal relevance of intentional properties. The causal- irrelevance argument applied to intentional properties lacks a premise connecting a weaker possibility (that some brain states should have some particular behavioral effect while lacking the intentional property in question) to a stronger claim (that all those brain states should have the same behavioral effects while lacking the given intentional property). This premise could, I believe, only be supplied by empirical investigation, and it has not, as yet, been supplied. So, the argument does not provide a convincing demonstration that intentional properties are causally irrelevant to behavior. I end the paper by discussing several objections to this defense of the causal relevance of intentional properties.",

            "abstract": "What role should philosophical theories of intentionality play in cognitive science? Philosophers argue on conceptual grounds about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of attributing intentional states to animals, to computers, and even to humans. I argue that a comparative approach to cognitive science (CACS) allows cognitive scientists to sidestep these disputes by treating philosophical theories as starting points for empirical investigation. For this purpose, philosophical theories of intentionality are most useful when they are naturalistic and not anthropocentric, and when they provide a framework for empirical research that does not place a priori constraints on what kinds of things can possess intentionality. I apply these criteria critically to recent philosophical views of intentionality and I show how particular attention to the comparative part of CACS should influence attempts to develop a theoretically useful conception of intentionality. In particular, this perspective shows that insistence on defining intentionality prior to experimental work is misguided\n rather, an empirical, comparative approach to refining the notion of intentionality should be attempted. Finally, I discuss the consequences of different conceptions of intentionality for empirical work in ethology and artificial intelligence.",
